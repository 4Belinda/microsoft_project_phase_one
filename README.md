variables that were of interest to our study include; types of films, income generated by exisiting movie  
studios and consumer preferrences. Exploratory data analysis was conducted on the variables to investigate 
on their relationships. The analysis was able to discover a relationship between the three variables where 
consumer preferences towards certain films tend to lead to an increase the income generated by production 
companies. Films based on drama, documentary and comedy are the most preferred by consumers and production 
comapnies gain huge incomes from them.
